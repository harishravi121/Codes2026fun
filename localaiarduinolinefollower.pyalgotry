To build a "self-learning" line follower with 1 GB of data, you need two distinct pieces of code:

1. **Python Script:** To process your 1 GB of training data (images or sensor logs) and "teach" the AI.
2. **Arduino Sketch:** To run the finished AI model locally on your robot hardware.

### **Part 1: The Local AI Trainer (Python)**

Because 1 GB of data is too large for an Arduino to process, you train the brain on your computer first. This code uses **TensorFlow** to learn how to drive based on your recorded data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# 1. Load your 1GB Dataset (Assuming a CSV of 5 IR sensor readings + steering)
# Use 'chunksize' to handle large data without crashing your RAM
data_path = "line_follower_data.csv"
chunk_size = 50000 

model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)), # 5 IR Sensors
    Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Outputs: 0=Left, 1=Straight, 2=Right
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

print("Training Local AI Brain...")
# Streaming the 1GB data through the model
for chunk in pd.read_csv(data_path, chunksize=chunk_size):
    X = chunk.iloc[:, :5].values # Sensors
    y = chunk.iloc[:, 5].values  # Steering Label
    model.train_on_batch(X, y)

# 2. Convert to TensorFlow Lite (for Arduino/Microcontroller)
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open("model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
print("Self-learning complete. Model saved as model.tflite")

```

### **Part 2: The Arduino "Local AI" Controller**

Arduino cannot run raw Python. You must use **TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers** or a simplified **Neural Network** library. This code takes the "knowledge" from the Python script and runs it on the robot.

```cpp
#include <EloquentTinyML.h> // Library to run the model locally
#include "model_data.h"     // Your exported model converted to a byte array

#define NUMBER_OF_INPUTS 5
#define NUMBER_OF_OUTPUTS 3
#define TENSOR_ARENA_SIZE 2*1024

// Initialize the AI Brain on Arduino
Eloquent::TinyML::TfLite<NUMBER_OF_INPUTS, NUMBER_OF_OUTPUTS, TENSOR_ARENA_SIZE> ml;

// Motor Pins
const int motorL = 5;
const int motorR = 6;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    ml.begin(model_data); // Load the 1GB-trained knowledge
}

void loop() {
    // 1. Read the 5 IR Sensors
    float inputs[5];
    for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
        inputs[i] = analogRead(A0 + i) / 1023.0; // Normalize data
    }

    // 2. Local AI Prediction (Inference)
    int prediction = ml.predict(inputs);

    // 3. Act based on AI decision
    if (prediction == 1) {      // Straight
        analogWrite(motorL, 150);
        analogWrite(motorR, 150);
    } else if (prediction == 0) { // Left
        analogWrite(motorL, 50);
        analogWrite(motorR, 200);
    } else {                    // Right
        analogWrite(motorL, 200);
        analogWrite(motorR, 50);
    }
}

```

### **How this works with 1 GB Data**

* **The Problem:** An Arduino Uno only has **2 KB** of RAM. It cannot "learn" from 1 GB of data while driving; it would be like trying to fit an entire library into a sticky note.
* **The Solution:** The Python code does the heavy lifting (the "Learning"). It compresses that 1 GB of experience into a tiny mathematical file (`model.tflite`).
* **The Execution:** The Arduino then uses that tiny file to make decisions in milliseconds, making it a "Self-Learning" system that was trained on a massive local dataset.

This video is relevant because it demonstrates the process of developing the logic and code for an advanced line follower, which is a key step before you can implement complex AI models.

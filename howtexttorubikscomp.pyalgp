suppose we are given a 5 page way to solve a 3x3 cube
how would you write a code to generate a random cube

how would you generate the set of 50 moves to solve each time for 3x3

how would you generate 800 moves for 5x5


THe only thing I wrote was 2 move solution with proof for 1x1

If you can write this in python you would be a good robotic level prof as being a prof is about typing solutions in tex
